# 🚀 SpaceX Launch Data Analysis – IBM Data Science Capstone (Coursera)

## 📌 Overview
This project is the final capstone of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera. It simulates a real-world data science workflow applied to **SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data**, with the goal of predicting launch success and identifying key performance patterns.

As a Data Scientist, I completed the full data science lifecycle—data collection, wrangling, exploration, visualization, SQL querying, machine learning, and dashboard development.

## 🔍 Objective
To analyze and predict SpaceX Falcon 9 booster landing outcomes using historical data. The insights support strategic decisions to improve rocket reusability and optimize launch operations.

## 🧪 Key Goals:
- Identify which launch sites are most successful
- Determine if payload mass impacts launch success
- Predict future success using machine learning models
- Present insights visually via dashboards and maps

## 🧠 Project Workflow
The project is divided into the following structured stages:

| Stage | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Data Collection | `1-jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api-v2.ipynb` | Fetched launch data from SpaceX API |
| Web Scraping | `2-jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb` | Retrieved additional data from Wikipedia |
| Data Wrangling | `3-labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling-v2.ipynb` | Cleaned, merged, and prepared the dataset |
| SQL Analysis | `4-jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb` | Analyzed data using SQL within Jupyter |
| Data Visualization | `5-jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz-v2.ipynb` | Explored trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn |
| Geo Visualization | `6-lab-jupyter-launch-site-location-v2.ipynb` | Mapped launch sites using Folium |
| Machine Learning | `7-SpaceX-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Part-5-v1.ipynb` | Built ML models to predict successful landings |
| Dashboard | `Dashboard.ipynb` | Created a Plotly Dash dashboard for insights |
| Presentation | `Ihtesham Usman Slides.pdf` | Final project presentation slides |

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Folium)
- SQLite (for SQL queries)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Plotly Dash (for dashboard)
- APIs & Web Scraping (requests, BeautifulSoup)

## 📁 Files Included
- `*.ipynb` notebooks for each stage of the workflow
- `spacex_launch_geo.csv` – cleaned dataset
- `DataScienceEcosystem.py` – environment setup script
- `Ihtesham Usman Slides.pdf` – project summary presentation

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Launch Site LC-40** and **CCAFS SLC 40** had highest success rates
- Higher payload mass showed moderate correlation with success
- Logistic Regression and Decision Tree performed best among models
- Dashboard shows interactive trends and outcomes by site, payload, and booster type
